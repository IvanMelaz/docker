# FreePBX on Docker
FreePBX container image for running a complete Asterisk server.

With this container you can create a telephony system in your office or house with integration among various office branches and integration to external VOIP providers with features such as call recording and IVR (interactive voice response) Menus.

If "Apply" is taking too long, disable "Module signature check" (if you know what you're doing).

Thanks to https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-freepbx and https://hub.docker.com/r/flaviostutz/freepbx for various insights on the new Asterisk 15 installation.
